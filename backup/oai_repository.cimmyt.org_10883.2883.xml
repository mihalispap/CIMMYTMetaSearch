  <dc:description>Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is one of the most widespread diseases in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) globally. With the objective of identifying and mapping new genes for resistance to leaf rust, F1, F2 plants and F3 lines from a cross between resistant cultivar Bimai 16 and susceptible cultivar Thatcher were inoculated with Chinese Puccinia triticina pathotypes FHTT and PHTS in the greenhouse. In the first seedling test, Bimai 16, Thatcher, 20 F1 plants, 359 F2 plants and 298 F3 lines were inoculated with pathotype FHTT. A set of 1,255 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs were used to test the parents, and resistant and susceptible bulks. Seven polymorphic markers on chromosome 7BL were used for genotyping the F2 and F3 populations. The results indicated that Bimai 16 carried a single dominant resistance gene, temporarily designated LrBi16, closely linked to SSR markers Xcfa2257 and Xgwm344, with genetic distances of 2.8 and 2.9 cM, respectively. In the second seedling test, two dominant resistance genes were identified in Bimai 16 based on seedling reactions of 254 F2 plants inoculated with pathotype PHTS. One of the genes was LrBi16, and the other was likely to be LrZH84, which is located in chromosome 1BL. The seedling reaction pattern of plants with LrBi16 was different from that of the Thatcher lines, with Lr14a and Lr14b located on chromosome 7BL. It was concluded that LrBi16 is likely to be a new leaf rust resistance gene.</dc:description>
