  <dc:description>Vitamin A and protein deficiencies afflict hundreds of millions of people, and because maize is a staple food providing a large portion of energy and nutrients for many, its genetic fortification or biofortification could significantly contribute to alleviating malnutrition. Therefore, we measured carotenoid and tryptophan contents for grain, nixtamalized (lime-cooked) maize, and processed snacks of 13 maize genotypes including landraces, quality protein maize (QPM) and non-QPM hybrids. An average 36% loss of provitamin A and an 8% increase in tryptophan were observed following nixtamalization and subsequent snack preparation by deep-frying. The correlations for physical properties of grain and maize flour with provitamin A were calculated to investigate whether secondary traits may be useful as indicators of provitamin A content. The correlation of chroma values with provitamin A contents was significant (P &lt; 0.05) for 15% and 25% hydrated maize flour (r = 0.57 and r = 0.51, respectively), but was not significant for whole maize kernels.</dc:description>
