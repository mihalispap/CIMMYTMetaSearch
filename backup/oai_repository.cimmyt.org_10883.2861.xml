  <dc:subject>Nematode control</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>In 1979 the anthelmintic activity of Abamectin' was first reported. Since then, multiple articles have described Abamectins? degradation and its efficacy against a wide variety of crop pests under different conditions. However, there is a gap in the literature concerning the potential of using Abamectin in an integrated management program for the control of plant parasitic nematodes. Therefore, this review article used selected literature to discuss the mode of action of Abamectin against plant parasitic nematodes, the environmental aspects of the compound, and the nematicidal effectiveness and range of activity to address this topic. According to what has been achieved and reported in a worldwide basis, it is concluded that Abamectin poses properties which make it suitable for an integrated nematode management program  and discuss its limitations.</dc:description>
