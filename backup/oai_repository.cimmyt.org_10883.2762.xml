  <dc:description>Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) play a key role in determining the processing quality of the end-use products of common wheat. The objectives of this study were to identify genes at Glu-A3 locus, develop the STS markers, and establish multiplex PCR with the STS markers for Glu-A3 alleles. Gene-specific PCR primers were designed to amplify six near-isogenic lines (NILs) and Glenlea with different Glu-A3 alleles (a, b, c, d, e, f and g) defined by the protein electrophoretic mobility. Three Glu-A3 genes with complete coding sequence were cloned, designated as GluA3-1, GluA3-2 and GluA3-3, respectively. Seven dominant allele-specific STS (sequence tagged sites) markers were designed based on the SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) among different allelic variants for the discrimination of the Glu-A3 protein alleles a, b, c, d, e, f and g. Four multiplex PCRs were established including Glu-A3b + Glu-A3f, Glu-A3d + Glu-A3f, Glu-A3d + Glu-A3g, and Glu-A3b + Glu-A3e. These markers and multiplex-PCR systems were validated on 141 CIMMYT wheat varieties and advanced lines with different Glu-A3 alleles, confirming that they can be efficiently used in marker-assisted breeding.</dc:description>
