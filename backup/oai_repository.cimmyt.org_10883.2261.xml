  <dc:description>Bihar has emerged as one of the most promising states for maize production in India, where it is cultivated in all the three seasons, viz. kharif, rabi and summer. This offers an opportunity for strengthening maize supply chain from seed to end-use. Different systems of maize seed delivery co-exist in the state. This study has been conducted in the Samastipur district (the largest maize growing district) of Bihar in 201011 and is based on surveys of seed producers, farmers, seed distributors, private seed companies and public research institutions as to understand the delivery system of maize seed in a value chain perspective. The study has mapped the value chain of public and private seed systems and has brought out the need for a greater emphasis on integration of different stakeholders involved in the chain. Appropriate backward and forward linkages of maize growers with seed companies are likely to generate better returns from maize. The enabling environment from the government policies to support services needs to be reoriented towards enhancing efficiency in seed delivery in the state.</dc:description>
