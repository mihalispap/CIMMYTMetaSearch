  <dc:description>In hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) disease resistance genes transferred hom alien sources are often associated,vith undesirable traits. Replicated trials using near-isogenic lines of spring wheat 'Seri 82' were conducted for 2 yr under non-moisture stress and simulated moisture stress conditions to determine the effects of the 7DL.7Ag and 1BL.1RS translocations [from Agropyron elongatum (Host) Beauv. and Secale cereale L., respectively] on grain yield and related traits. Mean grain yield of the 1B lines was significantly higher (3.2%) than that of the 1BL.1RS translocation lines in non-moisture stress trials, but not significantly higher in the moisture stress trials. The mean grain yields of the five highest yielding reconstituted Seri 82 genotypes (1BL.1RS) were significantly lower than that of the genotypes without the 1BL.1RS translocation in non-moisture stress (3.2%) and moisture stress (5.2%) conditions. Incorporation of the 7DL.7Ag translocation reused a significant increase (9%) in biomass at han est in non-moisture stress trials. The mean grain yields of the five highest yielding 7DL.7Ag lines were significantly higher (8.2%) than the reconstituted Seri 82 genotypes in non-moisture stress conditions and more than 16% lower under moisture stress. Lower grain yields of the 7DL.7Ag lines under moisture stress could be due to their excessive pre-heading biomass production. Several yield-related traits of the near-isogenic genotypes varied significantly. Presence of each translocation caused lateness and, when present together, the 1BL.1RS and 7DL.7Ag translocations delayed heading and maturity by 7 and 5 d, respectively. The genetic background of the recipient wheat can affect the utility of a translocation.</dc:description>
