  <dc:description>Genotypes produced from plant breeding programs
for annual crops are evaluated in multiyear,
multilocation field trials where a large number
of genotypes grown in a few locations in the
first year are progressively reduced by selection
and tested in a greater number of locations in
successive years. Provided fixed resources are
specified, the efficiencies of testing strategies
differing in the number of locations and replications
used and in the number of genotypes
tested in successive years can be evaluated by
three statistics (genetic repeatability, acceptance
probability, and potential gain) calculated
from five variance components applicable
to the field trials. The five variance components
required are deployed genetic variance,
genotype-by-year, genotype-by-location, and
genotype-by-year-by-location interaction variances
and the residual (error) variance. Strictly,
known variance components are required, but
the statistics and their standard errors can be
calculated using robust estimates of the variance
components obtained from a combined
analysis over years of a large set of historical
data from field trials that are connected by
shared genotypes across years, as genotypeby-
year and genotype-by-year-by-location variance
components are estimable. Single-year
analyses are unsuitable, as no estimate of the
interactions with year are available, and such
analyses produce biased estimates of genetic
variance and genotype-by-location interaction
variance. These procedures are illustrated using
an example from the CIMMYT international
wheat breeding program to evaluate 2-yr testing
strategies for CIMMYTâ€™s Elite Spring Wheat
Yield Trials that has been distributed and evaluated
internationally since 1979.</dc:description>
