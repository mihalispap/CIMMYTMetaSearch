  <dc:description>Leaf rust is an important wheat disease and utilization of adult-plant resistance (APR) may be the best approach to achieve long-term protection from the disease. The CIMMYT spring wheat line Shanghai 3/Catbird (SHA3/CBRD) showed a high level of APR to Chinese Puccinia triticina pathotypes in the field. To identify APR genes in this line, a mapping population of 164 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross of this line and Naxos, a moderately susceptible German cultivar. The RILs were evaluated for final disease severity (FDS) at Baoding, Hebei province, and Zhoukou, Henan province, in the 2010?2011 and 2011?2012 cropping seasons. QTL analysis detected one major QTL derived from SHA3/CBRD on chromosome 2BS explaining from 15 to 37 % of the phenotypic variance across environments. In addition one minor resistance QTL on chromosome 1AL from SHA3/CBRD and four minor QTL from Naxos on chromosomes 2DL, 5B, 7BS, and 7DS were also detected. SHA3/CBRD also possessed seedling resistance gene Lr26, and Naxos contained Lr1 based on gene postulation following tests with an array of P. triticina pathotypes and molecular marker assays. These seedling resistance and APR genes and their closely linked molecular markers are potentially useful for improving leaf rust resistance in wheat breeding programs.</dc:description>
