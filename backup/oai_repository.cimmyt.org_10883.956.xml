  <dc:description>Data from formal farmer surveys in Iganga District, Uganda, as well as secondary data, were analysed to describe maize farmers' circumstances and practices, identify socioeconomic and technical factors affecting the adoption of improved maize variety Longe 1 and related practices, and develop recommendations for research, extension, and policy. The study area and its technology generation and transfer systems are described. The methodology used to collect and analise the data is reviewed, along with details on the technology package promoted to farmers. Farmers' most important criteria for adopting Longe 1 technology were (in descending order of importance) early maturity, high yield, large grains, and sweetness. Nonadopters preferred the older maize technology, Kawanga Composite A, because of its large kernels, high yield, and sweetness. Results of the logistic regresion model showed that the use of hired labour, level of education, membership in farmers' groups, and land tenure had statistically significant effect on the probability of adoption Longe 1 technology. The findings from this study point to several recommendations for research, extension, and policy makers. First, revised fertiliser and herbicide recommendations could help improve the profitability of Long 1. Second, farmers' use the older maize technology indicates that farmers should have access to more alternative maize seed types. Third, the extension service should strengthen contact with farmer groups. Fourth, labor-saving technologies such as herbicide and draft animals should be incorporated into the maize husbandry and post-harvest technology package. Fifth, a group revolving-fund loan scheme should be explored by formal and informal credit institutions as well as farmers' groups. Finally, universal primary education should be upheld so the economy can benefit from improved farm management skills acquired by literate farmers.</dc:description>
